## Types of Networks

-   Food webs
    -   Metawebs [@dunne2006]
    -   Realised webs
-   Non-trophic Webs

# Constructing Food Webs

## The Challenge

-   Empirical
-   Aggregation
-   Interaction vs structure

## Predicting interactions: Mechanistic models

-   Feasibility
-   Does species $a$ have the capacity to consume species $b$

## Predicting interactions: Deductive models

-   Realised networks
-   Body size and foraging models

## Predicting Structure

-   Species agnostic
-   Topology drive and constrained
